# Serverless Magic Eight Ball API

## Description

Wanted to try out deploying a simple FastAPI API to AWS API Gateway using the Serverless Framework

I really liked the magic eight ball swag from Whiz I got at fwdcloudsec so decided to implement an API endpoint that returns curated messages from the magic eight ball at random

A UI could be created for calling the endpoint by spinning a ball (can't code UI stuff at the pain of death; wasn't born with that part of the brain -:) )

## Things I plan to Explore

- Review the infrastructure that the serverless framework creates for from a security perspective
- Try building all the components using Terraform to highlight how much using the Serverless framework abstracts and simplifies the process.
- Any security anti-patterns or unsafe default settings?
- Implement API Key authentication and rate limiting on the endpoint

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ 

# Install npm, serverless framework and the plugins
$ 

# Set your AWS account credentials and run sls deploy
$
